# Hackerman


![hackerman image](hackerman.gif)

Think of a bulky computer terminal with green text quickly scrolling as one "hacks" a government agency or something silly like that. That is the essence of this game. You are a hacker at a terminal trying to hijack opponents' Bitcoin wallets. As you do this, you are being attacked by rivals. As such, you use your Bitcoin acquired from opponents to update your hacking equipment. This is accomplished by completing tasks which are unrelated to hacking, but nonetheless fun.
