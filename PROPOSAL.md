# Hackerman Project Proposal

### Game idea
Hackerman is a game loosely based on "Hollywood Hacking" which is the portrayal of hacking in mass media.

Think of a bulky computer terminal with green text quickly scrolling as one "hacks" a government agency or something silly like that. That is the essence of this game. You are a hacker at a terminal trying to hijack opponents' Bitcoin wallets. As you do this, you are being attacked by rivals. As such, you use your Bitcoin acquired from opponents to update your hacking equipment. This is accomplished by completing tasks which are unrelated to hacking, but nonetheless fun.

### Implementation details
The game will be implemented largely using the 2D graphics and sound modules of openFrameworks. The graphics module is essentially a wrapper around cairo and the sound module is a wrapper around rtAudio, PortAudio, OpenAL, and Kiss FFT or FMOD.

### Background and inspiration
I have background writing games in C, having previously made classic game clones using SDL. For this project, I draw most of my inspiration from classic "hacking" games such as Hacknet, Sunrise Hackathon, etc.
